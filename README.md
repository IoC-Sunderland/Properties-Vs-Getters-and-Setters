# Public, "Private" and "Protected" instance attributes
Other OO languages such as Java have the concept of Public, Private and Protected instance attributes.

In Java these are known as Access level modifiers.

Access level modifiers determine whether other classes can use a particular field or invoke a particular method (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html).

We can mimic these access modifiers in Python classes but they are not strictly enforced. See class example: underscores_in_python

# Java Style Vs Python Style Classes
Here we create a Java Style class in Python i.e. a class with Public, "Private" and "Protected" instance attributes.

We then show how we can write the same class in Python without access modifiers.
